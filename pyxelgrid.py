"""A grid-based pyxel game class.

The standard usage involves subclassing `PyxelGrid` with a concrete class and overriding some of the
functions, e.g.,

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    class MyGame(PyxelGrid[int]):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(r=5, c=7, dim=10)  # 5 rows, 7 columns, cell side length 10 pixels

        def init(self) -> None:
            # called once at initialization time
            ...

        def update(self) -> None:
            # called every frame
            ...

        def draw_cell(self, i: int, j: int, x: int, y: int) -> None:
            # draws cell (i, j)
            ...

        def pre_draw_grid(self) -> None:
            # performs graphics drawing before the main grid is drawn
            # drawing the background image (e.g. via pyxel.cls) can be done here
            ...


        def post_draw_grid(self) -> None:
            # performs graphics drawing after the main grid is drawn
            ...

Note that no method is required to be overridden.

To run the game, call the `run()` method, e.g.,

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    my_game = MyGame()

    # The keyword arguments are passed directly to pyxel.init
    my_game.run(title="My Game", fps=60)

The `run()` method automatically initializes `pyxel` for you, so you don't have to call `pyxel.init`
or `pyxel.run`.

The grid has `r` rows and `c` columns, and each cell of the grid is a square with a side
length of `dim` pixels. You can specify a "padding" on all four sides: `x_l` pixels to the
left, `x_r` pixels to the right, `y_u` pixels above, and `y_d` pixels below. (Every padding
defaults to 0.)

Individual cells are addressed by two coordinates `i` and `j`, representing the row and
column numbers, respectively. Row numbers start from the top, and column numbers start from
the right. These are both zero-indexed, so the top-left and bottom-right cells have
coordinates `(0, 0)` and `(r-1, c-1)`, respectively.

Each cell can hold a value or state, of (generic) type `T`. For example, `PyxelGrid[int]`
represents a grid of `int`s. Note that the cell's state must first be initialized before
using.

On drawing time, the `pre_draw_grid()` method is first called, then all cells are drawn individually
in row-major order, then finally the `post_draw_grid()` method is called.

By default, the grid is drawn as a single "layer". You can specify additional layers on top
of it by passing in `layerc` (which defaults to 0). Every layer is drawn one after the
other. The layers are drawn in increasing order (indexed `0` to `layerc - 1`) after the main grid.
Each layer is drawn in a similar way as the main grid; `pre_draw_layer()` is called, then the cells
are drawn in row-major order (via `draw_cell_layer()), then finally, `post_draw_layer()` is called.
